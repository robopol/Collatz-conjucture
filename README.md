# Collatz Conjecture – Testing & Exploration

This repository contains various scripts and documents related to exploring the **Collatz Conjecture** (often referred to as the *3n + 1 problem*). The goal is to experiment with different approaches, visualize patterns, and analyze sequences generated by the Collatz iteration.

## Contents

- **Collatz conjecture - testing.pdf**  
  A PDF document summarizing certain tests, results, or observations about the Collatz Conjecture.

- **advanced_test_collatz.py**  
  A Python script for more advanced or computationally intensive testing of Collatz sequences. May include optimizations or additional data logging.

- **basic_fractal_test_collatz.py**  
  A script exploring fractal-like patterns or visual representations derived from Collatz sequences.

- **Collatz conjecture 3+1**  
  A reference to the well-known “3+1” or “3n + 1” name for the Collatz Conjecture. (This could be a folder, file, or note on the main concept.)

- **simple_test_collatz.py**  
  A straightforward Python script to generate and examine basic Collatz sequences.

- **test_collatz.py**  
  Another Python script focusing on sequence generation, possibly with different parameters or data collection strategies.

## Overview of the Collatz Conjecture

The **Collatz Conjecture** states that for any positive integer \(n\):

1. If \(n\) is even, divide it by 2.
2. If \(n\) is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Repeatedly applying these rules is said to eventually lead to the number 1, regardless of the initial starting value. Despite extensive numerical evidence, the conjecture remains unproven for all integers.
